# Structure of the ANS Testing Policy Document

This document outlines a medical policy for Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Testing, typically used by health insurers to define coverage conditions and claim handling.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Policy Overview
- **General Statement**: Coverage is subject to member contracts.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Clause**: Services must be appropriate to the patientâ€™s needs and cost-effective.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Medical Necessity Criteria

### âž¤ Medically Necessary (Covered)
ANS testing is covered when:
- Used to diagnose vasomotor instability symptoms after ruling out other causes.
- It guides clinical decision-making for specific conditions (e.g., neuropathy, syncope, POTS).

### âž¤ Not Medically Necessary (Not Covered)
ANS testing is *not* covered for:
- Asymptomatic individuals (e.g., diabetic, hepatic, renal disease).
- Routine monitoring when stable.
- Situations where results don't impact management.

### âž¤ Experimental/Investigational
Testing is considered unproven and not covered when using:
- Devices like **ANSAR ANX 3.0**, **SUDOSCAN**, and **ESC**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Required Documentation
Documentation must show medical necessity:
- Clinical notes, provider documentation, and test reports.
- Failure to provide may result in claim denial.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Guidelines
- ANS testing is usually done in labs.
- Appropriate for disease progression or treatment response.
- Frequency depends on clinical changes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Benefit Application
- Coverage depends on the memberâ€™s contract.
- Services deemed not necessary or investigational will not be reimbursed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Clinical Description of ANS and Testing

### âž¤ ANS Overview
- Controls involuntary body functions (HR, BP, digestion, etc.).
- Comprised of **sympathetic** ("fight or flight") and **parasympathetic** ("rest and digest") systems.

### âž¤ Testing Categories
1. **Cardiovagal Testing** (e.g., HR response to deep breathing, Valsalva, standing)
2. **Adrenergic Testing** (e.g., beat-to-beat BP, tilt table, hand grip)
3. **Sudomotor Testing** (e.g., QSART, TST, sympathetic skin response)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. ANS Testing Devices
Describes devices such as:
- **ANSAR ANX 3.0**
- **SUDOSCAN / ESC**

Notes:
- These are noninvasive, automated, operator-independent.
- Use is not validated and therefore not covered.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Billing and Coding

### âž¤ CPT Codes
- **Medically Necessary**: 95921, 95922, 95923, 95924
- **Experimental**: 95999

### âž¤ ICD-10 Codes
- Extensive list provided for medically necessary diagnoses.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Policy History
Chronological changes, including:
- ICD-10 code updates
- Coding revisions
- Changes in coverage stance
- New technologies addressed

---

## âœ… Summary
This policy document:
- Defines covered vs. non-covered ANS testing.
- Details clinical rationale.
- Provides documentation and billing guidance.
